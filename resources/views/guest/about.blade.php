                    <p><strong>School vision statements outline a school's values and objectives. <br>
                            They provide parents and the community a brief but clear overview
                            <br>of the overall ethos of the school. On the other hand, school<br> mission statements
                            explains what the school is currently
                            doing to achieve its vision. Schools need both vision and mission <br>statements to show
                            their community what their values and benefits <br> are.
                            <br> We believe that a happy child is a successful one. We are <br>
                            committed to providing a positive, safe and supportive <br>
                            environment for the children to learn, where all are valued. We intend <br>
                            that all children should enjoy their learning, achieve their <br>potentials and
                            become independent life-long learners. </p>
